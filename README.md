# GRID-CPS - NQ-Router - Under Development
A I4.0 Doctoral Thesis Repository

To keep the different parts of the project well-organized, reproducible, and independent (e.g., separate experiments, paper versions, thesis chapters, or major development stages), **the files are intentionally separated across multiple branches** instead of mixing everything in a single branch or directory tree.
